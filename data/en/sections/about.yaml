summary: >
  I am a passionate software engineer with 10 years of working experience.
  I have been blessed with an interesting journey since I left <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">Virginia</a> that took me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>.
  Now, I have returned to the east coast and currently reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area">Washington, D.C. metro</a> area.
  I build tools and backends using Go primarily. I have experience in various cloud providers and work with various cloud native technologies like Kubernetes and Docker.
  I love to improve the development and production experience for others.
