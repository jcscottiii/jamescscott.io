Earlier this year I went through the interviewing process. I wanted to document the resources I used to help out anyone else in the future.

### Coding Resources

It is typical for entry-level to the highest level of coders to have to do coding interviews. I found these extremely helpful.

#### Educative.io - Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions

This [class](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) was tremendously helpful. This self-paced course break downs common patterns seen coding interviews.

They give you the concept, then a series of problems. You can solve problem directly on their website. No need to setup your coding environment for each problem.

There is one downside: You have to pay for it. I opted for the single month subscription plan which was $60. 

###### Why is this course worth it?

Interviewing is never natural. So coming back into the world of doing them can be daunting. This course helps establish a great baseline of knowledge.

#### Leetcode Premium

I have always used the free version Leetcode and was too cheap to buy premium. But I figured, if I pay Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Crunchyroll, etc, I can pay for [Leetcode Premium](https://leetcode.com/subscribe/) for a month. Which is worth $35.


###### Why is this course worth it?

It provides a curated list of questions asked by the big tech companies. Not only that, each company's list is sorted by how frequent a certain is asked. I found this to be an amazing asset when trying to study. This helped me prioritize my time and helped me focus on patterns that I had gaps with.

### System Design Resources

For the senior level and upwards, it is typical to system design interviews. These are the resources I used.
