Welcome!

My name is James C. Scott III.

I am a <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/jamescscott/">Software Engineer</a> who has been blessed with an interesting journey since I left <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">Virginia</a> that took me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. Now, I reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area">Washington, D.C. metro</a> area. I really like to dabble in everything. I decided it would be great to contribute to the mighty Internet and write about these things! These are my <a href="http://jamescscott.io">thoughts</a>.

Recently, I started my <a href="https://github.com/jcscottiii">GitHub</a> account as well. As I begin making posts, I'll post the sample code there as well!

When I'm not coding or tinkering, I love to stay active by playing volleyball, soccer, going snowboarding, playing video games, and going to the beach!
