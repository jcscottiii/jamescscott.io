Welcome!

My name is James.

I am a Software Engineer who has been blessed with an interesting journey since I left <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">Virginia</a> that took me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. Now, I reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area">Washington, D.C. metro</a> area. I really like to dabble in everything. I decided it would be great to contribute to the Interwebs and write about these things! These are my <a href="http://jamescscott.io">thoughts</a>.
